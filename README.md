# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
 A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.  In this project, we will perform A/B test for a company to compare between two version of web page one is old and the another is new, by the A/B test result we will help the company decided if they going to implement the new page or keep the old page.
